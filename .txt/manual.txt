0. CHOICES:
Throughout [puppet], from first loading the game to exploring the XYZ
facility, you'll encounter choices. Depending on your style of gameplay 
(e.g. text adventure (through terminal), audio-only, or GUI), these
choices will allow you to employ your decision-making and guide your
character to safety.

In the standard terminal version, choices will appear like this:

0. New
1. Resume
2. Options
3. Manual
4. Exit
Enter: 

The "Enter: " allows you to (in this case) type in what you want to do.
If you wanted to start a new run of [puppet], you would enter "0" or
"New", depending on your Input Type (Enumeration vs. String). 

These choices will then do the appropriate logic up until requiring a 
new decision to be made. Because there are many choices, [puppet] allows
you to automate decisions, using the same machine learning that the enemy
is using to learn how to defeat you. However, this cannot be done until 
the action is manually completed once by the user, so it is important to
know exactly what each choice does. A description has been provided below:
